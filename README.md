# FoodieFaves
This is our project for our Human-Computer Interaction subject. FoodieFaves is a food recommendation app that helps users discover new meals based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, and previous favorites. It offers an interactive and user-friendly interface designed with accessibility and user experience principles in mind.
